  {"name": "Amit", "department": "IT", "salary": 60000},
  {"name": "Riya", "department": "HR", "salary": 45000},
  {"name": "John", "department": "IT", "salary": 80000}
]

def high_earners_by_department(filename, department, min_salary):

Requirements:
1. Load JSON safely
2. Filter employees:
    a. matching department
    b. salary ≥ min_salary
3. Use:
    a. filter
    b. lambda
4. Return a list of names sorted by salary (descending)
